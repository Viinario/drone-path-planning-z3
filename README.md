# drone-path-planning-z3

This project explores different approaches for drone route planning, focusing on battery consumption and possible path configurations.

## Project Content

- **[drone_all_possible_paths.ipynb](drone_all_possible_paths.ipynb)**  
  Notebook that lists all possible drone trajectories.

- **[drone_best_battery_all_possible_paths.ipynb](drone_best_battery_all_possible_paths.ipynb)**  
  Notebook that finds drone paths with the best battery usage.

- **[drone_correct_consumption.ipynb](drone_correct_consumption.ipynb)**  
  Notebook demonstrating calculations and logic for correct battery consumption during route planning.

- **[drone_incorrect_consumption.ipynb](drone_incorrect_consumption.ipynb)**  
  Notebook showing scenarios with incorrect battery consumption, aiding in identifying and correcting issues.
